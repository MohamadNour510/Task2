# 🩺 Heart Disease Dataset - Data Cleaning Project

This project focuses on real-world data cleaning using Python and Pandas. The dataset used contains patient records related to heart disease.

## 📌 Dataset Info
- **Source**: [Heart Disease UCI - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
- **Rows**: 918
- **Columns**: 12  
- **Format**: CSV

## 🔍 Objectives
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Explore the data (shape, data types, null values, duplicates).
- Clean the data by handling duplicates and verifying data types.
- Save the cleaned dataset for further use.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Checked for missing values → None found.
- Found and removed 1 duplicate row.
- Verified and adjusted data types.
- Exported the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_data.csv`.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📄 Files Included
- `notebook.ipynb`: Colab/Jupyter notebook with the full cleaning process.
- `cleaned_data.csv`: Final cleaned dataset.
- `Heart_Disease_Data_Cleaning_Report.pdf`: Summary report of the cleaning process.
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions.

## 📝 Notes
This project is part of a data science learning activity aimed at practicing real-world data handling and preparing datasets for machine learning.
